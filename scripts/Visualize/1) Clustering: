DMP: 
	Motion Specific
	Position Heavy

Approach:
	No visual context
	No intent
	No context of "use" (pre-conditions)

Segmentation: 
	Velocity / Acceleration based: Only motion
	No appearance information / intent

Clustering: 
	Motion based
	Even featurizing with start / goal blah is still motion specific





DMPs: 

The DMP framework is excellent for smooth reconstructions of relatively simple trajectories; but it doesn't handle more complex extended trajectories very well (under rapidly changing forces or directions of motion).

Clustering: 
Clustering the force weights provides good homogenous clusters for a given segmentation; the cluster centres can be used to initialize new "representative" DMPs. However, this only considers the motion aspect of primitives, and ignores "when" these primitives may be used, or any visual context. 
We would need to reconsider how to cluster once we incorporate visual features.

Segmentation: 
With uniform segments, most of the primitives are "C" shaped, with varying extents of curvature or motion, which is fairly simple. Some segments capture more complex primitives, such as the "S" shaped primitive. We require a form of segmentation to break down the trajectory sparingly, so the resultant segments represent more complex behaviors, but can still be reconstructed by DMPs. 

Regarding the visual component: 
The approach we are considering now places heavy emphasis on the motion, but doesn't consider factors such as visual appearance, or higher level context (like the pre-conditions Katharina mentioned).
